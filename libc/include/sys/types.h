 * This allows for 256 file descriptors: if NR_OPEN is ever grown beyond that
 * you'll have to change this too. But 256 fd's seem to be enough even for such
 * "real" unices like SunOS, so hopefully this is one limit that doesn't have
 * to be changed.
 *
 * Note that POSIX wants the FD_CLEAR(fd,fdsetp) defines to be in <sys/time.h>
 * (and thus <linux/time.h>) - but this is a more logical place for them. Solved
 * by having dummy defines in <sys/time.h>.

/*
 * Those macros may have been defined in <gnu/types.h>. But we always
